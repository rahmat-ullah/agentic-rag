## 🔧 **Next Steps for Development Team**

### **Immediate Actions Required**
1. **Start Docker Desktop** (required for running services)
2. **Update .env file** with your specific configuration values
3. **Run development setup**: `python scripts/setup-dev.py`
4. **Start services**: `docker-compose up -d`
5. **Run health check**: `scripts/health-check.bat` (Windows) or `scripts/health-check.sh` (Linux)

### **Development Workflow**
1. **Install dependencies**: `pip install -e ".[dev]"`
2. **Run database migrations**: `python scripts/migrate.py upgrade head`
