## Technical Considerations

### Agent Architecture
```python
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, name: str, capabilities: List[str]):
        self.name = name
        self.capabilities = capabilities
        self.status = "ready"
    
    async def execute(self, task: Task, context: Context) -> Result:
        """Execute a task with given context"""
        pass
    
    def can_handle(self, task: Task) -> bool:
        """Check if agent can handle the task"""
        pass
```

### Workflow Definition
```yaml
workflow:
  name: "complex_query_processing"
  steps:
    - name: "analyze_query"
      agent: "planner"
      inputs: ["user_query"]
      outputs: ["query_intent", "required_tools"]
    
    - name: "retrieve_documents"
      agent: "retriever"
      inputs: ["query_intent"]
      outputs: ["relevant_documents"]
      depends_on: ["analyze_query"]
    
    - name: "synthesize_answer"
      agent: "synthesizer"
      inputs: ["relevant_documents", "user_query"]
      outputs: ["final_answer"]
      depends_on: ["retrieve_documents"]
```

### Performance Requirements
- Agent coordination overhead < 100ms
- Support 50+ concurrent workflows
- Workflow execution time < 10 seconds (95th percentile)
- Agent failure recovery < 2 seconds

### Agent Types
- **Planner**: Query analysis and workflow orchestration
- **Retriever**: Document search and retrieval
- **Synthesizer**: Answer generation and formatting
- **Redactor**: Privacy and security enforcement
- **Analyzer**: Specialized analysis tasks
- **Pricer**: Pricing analysis and calculations

## Quality Metrics

### Orchestration Quality

- **Workflow Efficiency**: Optimal tool selection rate
- **Error Recovery**: Successful recovery from failures
- **Resource Utilization**: Efficient agent usage

### Performance Metrics
- **Orchestration Latency**: Time to coordinate agents
