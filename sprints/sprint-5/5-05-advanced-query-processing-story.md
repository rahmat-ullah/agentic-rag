## Technical Considerations

### Document Comparison Algorithm
```python
class DocumentComparator:
    def compare(self, doc1: Document, doc2: Document) -> ComparisonResult:
        """Compare two documents and identify differences"""
        pass
    
    def align_sections(self, doc1: Document, doc2: Document) -> List[SectionPair]:
        """Align comparable sections between documents"""
        pass
    
    def detect_changes(self, section1: Section, section2: Section) -> List[Change]:
        """Detect specific changes between sections"""
        pass
```

### Summarization Strategies
- **Extractive**: Select most important sentences
- **Abstractive**: Generate new summary text
- **Hybrid**: Combine extractive and abstractive approaches
- **Key Points**: Extract bullet-point summaries
- **Executive Summary**: High-level overview

### Compliance Framework
```yaml
compliance_rules:
  security_requirements:
    - rule: "encryption_required"
      pattern: "encryption|SSL|TLS|AES"
      required: true
    
    - rule: "access_control"
      pattern: "authentication|authorization|access control"
      required: true
  
  performance_requirements:
    - rule: "response_time"
      pattern: "response time|latency"
      threshold: "< 2 seconds"
```

### Risk Categories
- **Financial Risk**: Cost overruns, pricing issues
- **Technical Risk**: Implementation challenges, compatibility
- **Schedule Risk**: Delivery delays, timeline issues
- **Compliance Risk**: Regulatory violations, standard gaps
- **Vendor Risk**: Reliability, financial stability

### Performance Requirements
- Document comparison < 10 seconds for 100-page docs
- Summarization < 5 seconds for 50-page documents
- Table extraction < 3 seconds per table
- Compliance checking < 15 seconds per document
- Risk assessment < 8 seconds per document

### Analysis Output Format
```json
{
  "analysis_type": "document_comparison",
  "results": {
    "differences": [
      {
        "section": "Technical Requirements",
        "type": "modification",
        "description": "Updated memory requirement from 8GB to 16GB",
        "confidence": 0.95
      }
    ],
    "summary": {
      "total_differences": 15,
      "major_changes": 3,
      "minor_changes": 12
    },
