- [ ] Answer quality assessment and validation
- [ ] Handling of conflicting or incomplete information

**Story Points:** 8

### Story 5-03: Redaction and Privacy Protection
**As a system, I want to redact sensitive information based on user roles so that confidential data is protected appropriately.**

**File:** [5-03-redaction-privacy-story.md](5-03-redaction-privacy-story.md)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] PII detection and redaction algorithms
- [ ] Role-based redaction policies
- [ ] Pricing information masking for unauthorized users
- [ ] Configurable redaction rules
- [ ] Audit trail for redaction activities

**Story Points:** 8

### Story 5-04: Pricing Analysis Tools
**As a user, I want specialized pricing analysis so that I can understand costs, compare offers, and make informed decisions.**

**File:** [5-04-pricing-analysis-story.md](5-04-pricing-analysis-story.md)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Pricing table extraction and normalization
- [ ] Currency conversion and standardization
- [ ] Cost comparison across offers
- [ ] Pricing trend analysis
- [ ] Total cost calculations with breakdowns

**Story Points:** 8

### Story 5-05: Advanced Query Processing
**As a user, I want to perform complex analysis tasks so that I can compare documents, summarize content, and extract specific information.**

**File:** [5-05-advanced-query-processing-story.md](5-05-advanced-query-processing-story.md)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Document comparison and difference analysis
- [ ] Content summarization with key points
- [ ] Table extraction and analysis
- [ ] Compliance checking against requirements
- [ ] Risk assessment and identification

**Story Points:** 8

## Dependencies
- Sprint 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure
- Sprint 2: Document Ingestion Pipeline
- Sprint 3: Basic Retrieval & Vector Search
- Sprint 4: Contextual Retrieval & Three-Hop Search

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Agent coordination complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Start with simple workflows, incremental complexity
- **Risk**: LLM costs for synthesis and analysis
  - **Mitigation**: Optimize prompts, cache results, cost monitoring
- **Risk**: Redaction accuracy affecting usability
  - **Mitigation**: Extensive testing, user feedback, manual review options

## Technical Architecture

### Agent Types
- **Planner**: Query analysis and tool selection
- **Retriever**: Contextual search and retrieval
- **Synthesizer**: Answer generation with citations
- **Redactor**: Privacy and security enforcement
- **Analyzer**: Specialized analysis tasks
- **Pricer**: Pricing analysis and normalization

### Orchestration Flow
1. Query analysis → intent classification
2. Tool selection → workflow planning
3. Agent execution → result collection
4. Result synthesis → final response
5. Quality assessment → feedback loop

### Key Components
- **Agent Registry**: Available agents and capabilities
- **Workflow Engine**: Task orchestration and execution
- **Context Manager**: Shared state across agents
- **Result Synthesizer**: Multi-agent result combination
- **Quality Assessor**: Output validation and scoring

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All user stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Agent orchestration handles complex multi-step queries
- [ ] Answer synthesis produces high-quality responses
- [ ] Redaction properly protects sensitive information
- [ ] Pricing analysis provides accurate insights
- [ ] Advanced query types work reliably
