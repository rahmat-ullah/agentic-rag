## Technical Considerations

### Synthesis Prompt Template
```
Based on the following retrieved information, provide a comprehensive answer to the user's question.

Question: {user_query}

Retrieved Information:
{retrieved_chunks}

Instructions:
1. Synthesize information from multiple sources
2. Include proper citations [1], [2], etc.
3. Highlight any conflicting information
4. Note if information is incomplete
5. Provide a clear, structured answer

Answer:
```

### Citation Format
```
[1] Document Title, Section Name, Page X
[2] Another Document, Chapter Y, Page Z
```

### Quality Metrics
