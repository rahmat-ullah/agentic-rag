# Sprint 2: Document Ingestion Pipeline (2 weeks)

## Sprint Goal
Implement the complete document ingestion pipeline that can process various document types (PDFs, Office docs, images) using IBM Granite-Docling, extract structured content, and store it in the system.

## Sprint Objectives
- Integrate IBM Granite-Docling for document parsing
- Implement file upload and storage system
- Create document processing and chunking pipeline
- Set up object storage for original files
- Implement basic document management endpoints

## Deliverables
- Working document upload API endpoint
- Granite-Docling integration for document parsing
- Document chunking and preprocessing pipeline
- Object storage integration (S3-compatible)
- Document management API endpoints
- Comprehensive testing for ingestion pipeline

## User Stories

### Story 2-01: File Upload and Storage
**As a user, I want to upload documents to the system so that they can be processed and made searchable.**

**File:** [2-01-file-upload-storage-story.md](2-01-file-upload-storage-story.md)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Support multiple file formats (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, images)
- [ ] File validation and size limits enforced
- [ ] Files stored securely in object storage
- [ ] Duplicate detection based on SHA256 hash
- [ ] Upload progress tracking and error handling

**Story Points:** 8

### Story 2-02: Granite-Docling Integration
**As a system, I want to parse uploaded documents using Granite-Docling so that I can extract structured content and metadata.**

**File:** [2-02-granite-docling-integration-story.md](2-02-granite-docling-integration-story.md)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Granite-Docling service integrated and configured
- [ ] Document parsing extracts text, tables, and layout
- [ ] Metadata extraction (pages, sections, structure)
- [ ] Error handling for parsing failures
- [ ] Performance optimization for large documents

**Story Points:** 13

### Story 2-03: Document Chunking Pipeline
**As a system, I want to chunk documents intelligently so that content can be efficiently searched and retrieved.**

**File:** [2-03-document-chunking-story.md](2-03-document-chunking-story.md)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Contextual chunking implementation
- [ ] Section-aware chunking preserving document structure
- [ ] Table detection and special handling
- [ ] Chunk deduplication within documents
- [ ] Configurable chunking parameters

**Story Points:** 8

### Story 2-04: Document Management API
**As a user, I want to manage my uploaded documents so that I can view, update, and organize them.**

**File:** [2-04-document-management-api-story.md](2-04-document-management-api-story.md)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] List documents with filtering and pagination
- [ ] View document details and metadata
- [ ] Document status tracking (processing, ready, failed)
- [ ] Document deletion with cleanup
- [ ] Document linking for RFQ-Offer relationships

**Story Points:** 5

## Dependencies
- Sprint 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure (database, API framework)

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Granite-Docling integration complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Early proof of concept, fallback parsing options
- **Risk**: Large file processing performance
  - **Mitigation**: Async processing, chunked uploads, progress tracking
- **Risk**: Document format compatibility issues
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing with real documents, error handling

## Technical Architecture

### Document Processing Flow
1. File upload → validation → object storage
2. Async processing trigger → Granite-Docling parsing
3. Content extraction → contextual chunking
4. Metadata storage → status update
5. Error handling and retry logic

### Key Components
- **Upload Service**: File handling, validation, storage
- **Processing Service**: Async document processing
- **Parsing Service**: Granite-Docling integration
- **Chunking Service**: Intelligent content chunking
- **Storage Service**: Object storage abstraction

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All user stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Integration tests passing for complete ingestion flow
- [ ] Performance testing with various document sizes
- [ ] Error handling tested with malformed documents
- [ ] Documentation updated with API specifications
- [ ] Demo prepared showing end-to-end document processing
