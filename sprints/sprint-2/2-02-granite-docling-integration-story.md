# User Story: Granite-Docling Integration

## Story Details
**As a system, I want to parse uploaded documents using Granite-Docling so that I can extract structured content and metadata.**

**Story Points:** 13  
**Priority:** High  
**Sprint:** 2

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Granite-Docling service integrated and configured
- [ ] Document parsing extracts text, tables, and layout
- [ ] Metadata extraction (pages, sections, structure)
- [ ] Error handling for parsing failures
- [ ] Performance optimization for large documents

## Tasks

### Task 1: Granite-Docling Service Setup
**Estimated Time:** 6 hours

**Description:** Set up and configure IBM Granite-Docling-258M service for document parsing.

**Implementation Details:**
- Deploy Granite-Docling as Docker service
- Configure model parameters and resource limits
- Set up service health monitoring
- Implement service discovery and load balancing
- Create service configuration management

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Granite-Docling service running in Docker
- [ ] Service properly configured with optimal parameters
- [ ] Health checks and monitoring implemented
- [ ] Service can handle concurrent requests
- [ ] Configuration externalized and manageable

### Task 2: Document Parsing Client
**Estimated Time:** 5 hours

**Description:** Create client wrapper for Granite-Docling service with proper error handling.

**Implementation Details:**
- Implement async HTTP client for Granite-Docling API
- Add request/response serialization
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Add timeout and circuit breaker patterns
- Create parsing result validation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Client can communicate with Granite-Docling service
- [ ] Async operations don't block other requests
- [ ] Retry logic handles temporary failures
- [ ] Circuit breaker prevents cascade failures
- [ ] Parsing results properly validated

### Task 3: Content Extraction Pipeline
**Estimated Time:** 6 hours

**Description:** Implement content extraction pipeline that processes Granite-Docling output.

**Implementation Details:**
- Parse structured JSON output from Granite-Docling
- Extract text content with proper formatting
- Identify and extract tables with structure
- Extract document layout and hierarchy
- Implement content cleaning and normalization

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Text content extracted with formatting preserved
- [ ] Tables identified and structure maintained
- [ ] Document hierarchy properly parsed
- [ ] Content cleaned and normalized
- [ ] Extraction handles various document types

### Task 4: Metadata Extraction
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours

**Description:** Extract comprehensive metadata from parsed documents.

**Implementation Details:**
- Extract document properties (title, author, creation date)
- Identify page count and page boundaries
- Extract section structure and headings
- Identify document type and classification
- Create metadata validation and enrichment

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Document properties extracted when available
- [ ] Page information accurately captured
- [ ] Section structure properly identified
- [ ] Document classification working
- [ ] Metadata validated and enriched

### Task 5: Error Handling and Fallbacks
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours

**Description:** Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms for parsing failures.

**Implementation Details:**
- Handle Granite-Docling service failures gracefully
- Implement fallback parsing using alternative methods
- Add detailed error logging and reporting
- Create parsing quality assessment
- Implement partial parsing recovery

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Service failures don't crash the system
- [ ] Fallback parsing provides basic functionality
- [ ] Errors properly logged with context
- [ ] Parsing quality can be assessed
- [ ] Partial failures handled gracefully

### Task 6: Performance Optimization
**Estimated Time:** 3 hours

**Description:** Optimize parsing performance for large documents and high throughput.

**Implementation Details:**
- Implement document preprocessing for optimization
- Add parallel processing for multi-page documents
- Optimize memory usage during parsing
- Implement caching for repeated parsing
- Add performance monitoring and metrics

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Large documents processed efficiently
- [ ] Memory usage optimized and bounded
- [ ] Parallel processing improves throughput
- [ ] Caching reduces redundant work
- [ ] Performance metrics collected

## Dependencies
- Sprint 1: Database Schema (for storing parsing results)
- Sprint 2: File Upload and Storage (for accessing uploaded files)

## Technical Considerations

### Granite-Docling Configuration
- Model selection based on document types
- Resource allocation (CPU, memory, GPU if available)
- Batch processing configuration
- Quality vs. speed trade-offs

### Document Type Support
- **PDF**: Text extraction, table detection, layout analysis
- **Office Documents**: DOCX, PPTX, XLSX with structure preservation
- **Images**: OCR processing for scanned documents
- **Complex Layouts**: Multi-column, forms, technical drawings

### Performance Requirements
- Process documents up to 100 pages within 2 minutes
- Support concurrent processing of multiple documents
- Memory usage bounded to prevent system overload
- Graceful degradation under high load

### Quality Assurance
- Parsing accuracy validation
- Content completeness checks
- Structure preservation verification
- Error rate monitoring

## Error Scenarios

### Service Failures
- Granite-Docling service unavailable → Fallback to basic parsing
- Model loading failure → Service restart and notification
- Resource exhaustion → Queue management and throttling

### Document Issues
- Corrupted files → Error reporting and manual review queue
- Unsupported formats → Clear error messages
- Password-protected documents → User notification for password
- Extremely large documents → Chunked processing

### Performance Issues
- Slow parsing → Progress updates and timeout handling
- Memory issues → Document size limits and optimization
- High load → Queue management and load balancing

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All tasks completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Integration tested with various document types
- [ ] Performance testing with large documents completed
- [ ] Error handling tested with malformed documents
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms validated
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Documentation complete with troubleshooting guide

## Notes
- Consider implementing parsing quality scoring
- Plan for future model updates and versioning
- Monitor parsing costs and optimize for efficiency
- Ensure compliance with document processing regulations
