# User Story: File Upload and Storage

## Story Details
**As a user, I want to upload documents to the system so that they can be processed and made searchable.**

**Story Points:** 8  
**Priority:** High  
**Sprint:** 2

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Support multiple file formats (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, images)
- [ ] File validation and size limits enforced
- [ ] Files stored securely in object storage
- [ ] Duplicate detection based on SHA256 hash
- [ ] Upload progress tracking and error handling

## Tasks

### Task 1: File Upload API Endpoint
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours

**Description:** Create secure file upload endpoint with proper validation and error handling.

**Implementation Details:**
- Implement POST /ingest endpoint with multipart form data
- Add file type validation (MIME type and extension)
- Implement file size limits (configurable)
- Add tenant-based upload quotas
- Create upload progress tracking

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Endpoint accepts multipart file uploads
- [ ] File type validation prevents unsupported formats
- [ ] Size limits enforced and configurable
- [ ] Proper error responses for validation failures
- [ ] Upload progress can be tracked

### Task 2: Object Storage Integration
**Estimated Time:** 5 hours

**Description:** Integrate S3-compatible object storage for secure file storage.

**Implementation Details:**
- Set up MinIO or AWS S3 client
- Implement secure file storage with proper naming
- Add file encryption at rest
- Create file retrieval and deletion functions
- Implement storage health checks

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Files stored securely in object storage
- [ ] Unique file naming prevents conflicts
- [ ] File encryption implemented
- [ ] Storage operations properly error handled
- [ ] Storage health monitoring working

### Task 3: File Validation and Security
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours

**Description:** Implement comprehensive file validation and security measures.

**Implementation Details:**
- Add virus scanning integration (ClamAV)
- Implement file content validation
- Add malicious file detection
- Create file quarantine system
- Implement audit logging for uploads

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Virus scanning prevents malicious uploads
- [ ] File content matches declared type
- [ ] Suspicious files properly quarantined
- [ ] All upload attempts logged
- [ ] Security violations reported

### Task 4: Duplicate Detection System
**Estimated Time:** 3 hours

**Description:** Implement SHA256-based duplicate detection to prevent redundant processing.

**Implementation Details:**
- Calculate SHA256 hash during upload
- Check for existing documents with same hash
- Implement deduplication logic per tenant
- Handle version updates for same document
- Create duplicate reporting

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] SHA256 hash calculated for all uploads
- [ ] Duplicate files detected and handled
- [ ] Tenant isolation for duplicate detection
- [ ] Version handling for document updates
- [ ] Duplicate statistics available

### Task 5: Upload Progress and Status Tracking
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours

**Description:** Implement real-time upload progress tracking and status management.

**Implementation Details:**
- Create upload session management
- Implement chunked upload support
- Add real-time progress updates via WebSocket
- Create upload status tracking (pending, processing, complete, failed)
- Implement upload resumption for large files

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Upload progress tracked in real-time
- [ ] Chunked uploads supported for large files
- [ ] Upload status properly maintained
- [ ] Failed uploads can be resumed
- [ ] Progress updates delivered to client

## Dependencies
- Sprint 1: API Framework (for endpoint implementation)
- Sprint 1: Database Schema (for document metadata storage)

## Technical Considerations

### File Format Support
- **Documents**: PDF, DOCX, PPTX, ODT, RTF
- **Images**: PNG, JPEG, TIFF (for OCR processing)
- **Archives**: ZIP (for batch uploads)

### Security Measures
- File type validation using both MIME type and magic bytes
- Virus scanning before storage
- Content validation to prevent malicious files
- Secure file naming to prevent path traversal

### Performance Considerations
- Chunked uploads for large files
- Async processing to prevent blocking
- Progress tracking without performance impact
- Efficient duplicate detection

### Storage Strategy
- Hierarchical storage by tenant and date
- File encryption at rest
- Backup and disaster recovery planning
- Storage cost optimization

## Error Handling Scenarios

### Upload Errors
- File too large → Clear error message with size limit
- Unsupported format → List of supported formats
- Virus detected → Security notification and quarantine
- Storage failure → Retry mechanism and fallback

### Network Errors
- Connection timeout → Resume capability
- Partial upload → Chunk verification and retry
- Client disconnect → Cleanup incomplete uploads

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All tasks completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Upload endpoint tested with various file types and sizes
- [ ] Security testing completed (malicious files, oversized files)
- [ ] Performance testing with concurrent uploads
- [ ] Error handling tested for all failure scenarios
- [ ] Documentation updated with API specifications

## Notes
- Consider implementing upload rate limiting per user/tenant
- Plan for future support of batch uploads
- Ensure compliance with data protection regulations
- Monitor storage costs and implement cleanup policies
