# User Story: Document Chunking Pipeline

## Story Details
**As a system, I want to chunk documents intelligently so that content can be efficiently searched and retrieved.**

**Story Points:** 8  
**Priority:** High  
**Sprint:** 2

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Contextual chunking implementation
- [ ] Section-aware chunking preserving document structure
- [ ] Table detection and special handling
- [ ] Chunk deduplication within documents
- [ ] Configurable chunking parameters

## Tasks

### Task 1: Basic Chunking Algorithm
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours

**Description:** Implement basic text chunking with configurable parameters.

**Implementation Details:**
- Create configurable chunk size and overlap parameters
- Implement sliding window chunking approach
- Add sentence boundary detection for clean breaks
- Handle edge cases (very short/long content)
- Create chunk metadata tracking

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Chunks created with configurable size limits
- [ ] Overlap between chunks maintains context
- [ ] Sentence boundaries respected for clean breaks
- [ ] Edge cases handled gracefully
- [ ] Chunk metadata properly tracked

### Task 2: Section-Aware Chunking
**Estimated Time:** 5 hours

**Description:** Implement intelligent chunking that respects document structure.

**Implementation Details:**
- Use document hierarchy from Granite-Docling parsing
- Preserve section boundaries in chunking
- Maintain heading context for chunks
- Handle nested sections appropriately
- Create section-based chunk organization

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Document structure preserved in chunking
- [ ] Section boundaries respected
- [ ] Heading context maintained
- [ ] Nested sections handled correctly
- [ ] Chunk organization follows document structure

### Task 3: Table Detection and Handling
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours

**Description:** Implement special handling for tables and structured content.

**Implementation Details:**
- Detect tables from Granite-Docling output
- Preserve table structure in chunks
- Handle table headers and relationships
- Create table-specific metadata
- Implement table content normalization

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Tables detected and preserved
- [ ] Table structure maintained in chunks
- [ ] Headers and relationships preserved
- [ ] Table metadata properly created
- [ ] Content normalization working

### Task 4: Chunk Deduplication
**Estimated Time:** 3 hours

**Description:** Implement deduplication to prevent redundant chunks within documents.

**Implementation Details:**
- Calculate content hashes for chunks
- Detect and merge similar chunks
- Handle near-duplicate content
- Preserve unique information
- Create deduplication reporting

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Content hashes calculated for all chunks
- [ ] Similar chunks detected and merged
- [ ] Near-duplicates handled appropriately
- [ ] Unique information preserved
- [ ] Deduplication statistics available

### Task 5: Chunking Pipeline Integration
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours

**Description:** Integrate chunking pipeline with document processing workflow.

**Implementation Details:**
- Connect chunking to Granite-Docling output
- Implement async chunking processing
- Add progress tracking for chunking
- Create error handling and recovery
- Integrate with metadata storage

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Chunking integrated with document processing
- [ ] Async processing prevents blocking
- [ ] Progress tracking implemented
- [ ] Error handling and recovery working
- [ ] Metadata storage integration complete

## Dependencies
- Sprint 2: Granite-Docling Integration (for parsed document structure)
- Sprint 1: Database Schema (for chunk metadata storage)

## Technical Considerations

### Chunking Strategy
- **Semantic chunking**: Preserve meaning and context
- **Structural chunking**: Respect document hierarchy
- **Size optimization**: Balance between context and performance
- **Overlap management**: Maintain continuity between chunks

### Performance Requirements
- Process 100-page document chunks within 30 seconds
- Memory usage bounded during chunking
- Parallel processing for large documents
- Efficient deduplication algorithms

### Quality Metrics
- Chunk coherence and completeness
- Structure preservation accuracy
- Deduplication effectiveness
- Processing speed and efficiency

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All tasks completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Chunking pipeline tested with various document types
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Quality metrics validated
- [ ] Integration with document processing complete
- [ ] Documentation updated with chunking specifications

## Notes
- Consider different chunking strategies for different document types
- Plan for future improvements based on search performance
- Monitor chunk quality and adjust parameters as needed
- Ensure chunking supports the three-hop retrieval pattern
