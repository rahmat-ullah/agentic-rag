- Add progress tracking for long-running operations
- Create status change notifications
- Implement status-based filtering and queries

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All status states properly defined and tracked
- [ ] Status updates occur at appropriate pipeline stages
- [ ] Progress tracking provides meaningful information
- [ ] Notifications sent for status changes
- [ ] Status-based queries work correctly

### Task 4: Document Deletion API
**Estimated Time:** 3 hours

**Description:** Implement secure document deletion with proper cleanup.

**Implementation Details:**
- Create DELETE /documents/{id} endpoint

- Clean up associated chunks and metadata
- Remove files from object storage
- Add bulk deletion capabilities

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Documents can be deleted securely
- [ ] Soft delete implemented with retention
- [ ] All associated data cleaned up
- [ ] Object storage files removed
- [ ] Bulk deletion works efficiently

### Task 5: Document Linking Management
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours

**Description:** Implement API for managing RFQ-Offer document relationships.

**Implementation Details:**
- Create POST /documents/{rfq_id}/links endpoint
- Implement link creation with confidence scoring
- Add link validation and conflict detection
- Create link listing and management endpoints
- Implement automatic link suggestions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Document links can be created and managed
- [ ] Confidence scoring works correctly
- [ ] Link validation prevents invalid relationships
- [ ] Link management endpoints functional
- [ ] Automatic suggestions provide value

## Dependencies
- Sprint 1: API Framework (for endpoint implementation)
- Sprint 1: Database Schema (for document metadata)
- Sprint 2: File Upload and Storage (for document data)

## Technical Considerations

### API Design Principles
- RESTful design with consistent patterns
- Proper HTTP status codes and error handling
- Comprehensive input validation
- Secure access control and authorization
- Clear and consistent response formats

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Pagination to handle large result sets
- Caching for frequently accessed data
- Async operations for long-running tasks
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Security Considerations
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Role-based access control
- Input sanitization and validation
- Secure file access and downloads
- Audit logging for all operations

## API Endpoints Summary

### GET /documents
- List documents with filtering and pagination
- Query parameters: type, status, date_from, date_to, search, page, size, sort

### GET /documents/{id}
- Get detailed document information
- Returns: metadata, status, statistics, download links

### DELETE /documents/{id}
- Delete document and associated data
- Supports soft delete with retention period

### POST /documents/{rfq_id}/links
- Create link between RFQ and Offer documents
- Body: offer_id, offer_type, confidence

### GET /documents/{rfq_id}/links
- List all links for an RFQ document
- Returns: linked offers with metadata and confidence scores

## Definition of Done
