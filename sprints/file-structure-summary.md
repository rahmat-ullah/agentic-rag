# Sprint File Structure Summary

## Overview
This document provides a complete overview of the sprint file structure with the new numerical naming convention applied.

## Naming Convention
All user story files follow the pattern: `[sprint-number]-[story-number]-[descriptive-name]-story.md`

- **Sprint Number**: Single digit (1-7)
- **Story Number**: Two-digit zero-padded (01, 02, 03, etc.)
- **Descriptive Name**: Kebab-case description of the story
- **Suffix**: Always ends with `-story.md`

## Story Count by Sprint

| Sprint | Stories | Story Points | Focus Area |
|--------|---------|--------------|------------|
| Sprint 1 | 4 | 26 | Foundation & Infrastructure |
| Sprint 2 | 4 | 34 | Document Ingestion |
| Sprint 3 | 5 | 34 | Basic Retrieval & Search |
| Sprint 4 | 5 | 39 | Contextual Retrieval |
| Sprint 5 | 5 | 45 | Agent Orchestration |
| Sprint 6 | 5 | 42 | Feedback & Learning |
| Sprint 7 | 6 | 45 | Production Deployment |
| **Total** | **34** | **265** | **Complete System** |

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Files
- All Sprint 1 stories (4/4)
- All Sprint 2 stories (4/4)
- Sprint 3: 2/5 stories completed
- Sprint 4: 1/5 stories completed
- Sprint 5: 0/5 stories (README only)
- Sprint 6: 0/5 stories (README only)
- Sprint 7: 0/6 stories (README only)

### 📝 Remaining Files to Create
- Sprint 3: 3 additional stories
- Sprint 4: 4 additional stories
- Sprint 5: 5 stories
- Sprint 6: 5 stories
- Sprint 7: 6 stories

**Total remaining:** 23 story files

## Benefits of New Naming Convention

### 1. **Clear Sequential Order**
- Files automatically sort in correct implementation order
- Easy to identify story sequence within each sprint
- Prevents confusion about story dependencies

### 2. **Consistent Structure**
- Uniform naming across all sprints
- Predictable file locations
- Easy to reference in documentation

### 3. **Scalability**
- Easy to add new stories within sprints
- Clear numbering system supports sprint expansion
- Maintains order even with file system sorting

### 4. **Team Collaboration**
- Developers can easily find and reference specific stories
- Clear communication about which story is being worked on
- Simplified code review and task assignment

## Usage Guidelines

### Creating New Stories
1. Determine the sprint number (1-7)
2. Identify the next available story number within that sprint
3. Create descriptive name using kebab-case
4. Follow the pattern: `[sprint]-[story]-[name]-story.md`

### Referencing Stories
- Use the full filename when referencing in documentation
- Include sprint context when discussing across sprints
- Link to specific stories in README files and dependency docs

### Maintaining Order
- Do not skip story numbers within a sprint
- If a story is removed, do not reuse the number
- Add new stories with the next available number

This naming convention ensures the sprint implementation plan remains organized, scalable, and easy to navigate throughout the development process.
