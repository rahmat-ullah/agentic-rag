## Technical Considerations

### Query Enhancement Pipeline
1. **Input Validation**: Check query format and length
2. **Intent Classification**: Determine query purpose and type
3. **Terminology Expansion**: Add domain-specific terms
4. **Context Injection**: Add relevant contextual information
5. **RFQ Hint Processing**: Extract and process procurement hints
6. **Strategy Selection**: Choose optimal search approach

### Intent Categories
- **Information Seeking**: General information requests
- **Comparison**: Comparing offers or requirements
- **Specification**: Looking for technical specifications
- **Pricing**: Price-related queries
- **Compliance**: Regulatory and compliance questions
- **Timeline**: Schedule and deadline inquiries

### Context Templates
```yaml
context_templates:
  pricing_query:
    context: "Focus on cost, pricing models, and financial terms"
    boost_fields: ["price", "cost", "budget", "financial"]
  
  technical_query:
    context: "Emphasize technical specifications and requirements"
    boost_fields: ["specification", "technical", "requirement"]
  
  compliance_query:
    context: "Prioritize regulatory and compliance information"
    boost_fields: ["compliance", "regulation", "standard", "certification"]
```

### Performance Requirements
- Query enhancement processing < 200ms
- Intent classification accuracy > 85%
- Context injection improves relevance by 15%
- Support 200+ concurrent query enhancements

### Enhancement Configuration
```yaml
query_enhancement:
