- Create link quality reporting
- Implement quality improvement suggestions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Validation rules prevent invalid links
- [ ] Quality metrics assess link value
- [ ] Automated assessment identifies issues
- [ ] Quality reporting provides insights
- [ ] Improvement suggestions help users

### Task 5: Bulk Linking Operations
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours

**Description:** Implement bulk operations for efficient link management.

**Implementation Details:**
- Create bulk link creation interface
- Implement batch processing for large datasets
- Add bulk validation and error handling
- Create progress tracking for bulk operations
- Implement bulk link quality assessment

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Bulk creation handles large datasets efficiently
- [ ] Batch processing prevents system overload
- [ ] Validation catches errors in bulk operations
- [ ] Progress tracking provides user feedback
- [ ] Quality assessment works for bulk links

## Dependencies
- Sprint 1: Database Schema (for document_link table)
- Sprint 2: Document Management API (for document metadata)
- Sprint 3: Vector Search (for similarity calculations)

## Technical Considerations

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE document_link (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    tenant_id UUID NOT NULL,
    rfq_document_id UUID NOT NULL,
    offer_document_id UUID NOT NULL,
    link_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'manual', 'automatic', 'suggested'
    confidence_score DECIMAL(3,2), -- 0.00 to 1.00
    created_by UUID,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    validated_by UUID,
    validated_at TIMESTAMP,
    metadata JSONB,
    UNIQUE(tenant_id, rfq_document_id, offer_document_id)
);
```

### Confidence Scoring Factors
- **Content Similarity**: Vector similarity between documents (40%)
- **Metadata Alignment**: Matching keywords, amounts, dates (30%)
- **Temporal Proximity**: Document creation/submission dates (15%)
- **User Validation**: Historical user acceptance rate (15%)

### API Endpoints
- `POST /documents/{rfq_id}/links` - Create link to offer
- `GET /documents/{rfq_id}/links` - Get all links for RFQ
- `DELETE /documents/{rfq_id}/links/{offer_id}` - Remove link
- `GET /documents/{rfq_id}/suggestions` - Get linking suggestions
- `POST /documents/links/bulk` - Bulk link operations

### Performance Requirements
- Link suggestion generation < 3 seconds
- Bulk operations handle 1000+ documents
- Confidence scoring < 500ms per link
- Support concurrent linking operations

## Quality Metrics

### Link Quality Indicators
- **Precision**: Correct links / Total links created
- **Recall**: Correct links found / Total correct links possible
- **User Acceptance**: Accepted suggestions / Total suggestions
- **Confidence Accuracy**: Actual quality vs predicted confidence

### Performance Metrics
- **Suggestion Speed**: Time to generate suggestions
- **Bulk Processing Rate**: Documents processed per minute
- **System Load**: Resource usage during linking operations

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All tasks completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Manual linking interface tested with real documents
- [ ] Automatic suggestions validated for accuracy
- [ ] Confidence scoring provides reliable predictions
- [ ] Link validation prevents data quality issues
- [ ] Bulk operations tested with large datasets

## Notes
- Consider implementing link approval workflows
- Plan for link quality monitoring and improvement
- Monitor user behavior to improve suggestion algorithms
- Ensure linking respects multi-tenant data isolation
