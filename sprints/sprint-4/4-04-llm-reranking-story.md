# User Story: LLM-Based Reranking

## Story Details

**As a system, I want to use LLM-based reranking so that search results are ordered by true relevance rather than just vector similarity.**

**Story Points:** 8  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Sprint:** 4

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] LLM reranking integration with OpenAI
- [ ] Reranking prompts optimized for procurement content
- [ ] Scoring criteria including relevance, specificity, completeness
- [ ] Batch reranking for performance
- [ ] Fallback to vector ranking if LLM unavailable

## Tasks

### Task 1: OpenAI LLM Integration

- Create LLM health monitoring

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] OpenAI client properly configured
- [ ] Model selection configurable
- [ ] API errors handled gracefully
- [ ] Request/response validation working

### Task 2: Procurement-Optimized Prompts

**Estimated Time:** 5 hours

**Description:** Develop and optimize prompts specifically for procurement content reranking.

**Implementation Details:**

- Create base reranking prompt template
- Develop procurement-specific scoring criteria
- Implement query-context prompt adaptation
- Add few-shot examples for better performance
- Create prompt versioning and A/B testing

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Base prompt template provides consistent results
- [ ] Procurement criteria improve relevance
- [ ] Prompt adaptation works for different queries
- [ ] Few-shot examples improve accuracy
- [ ] Versioning enables prompt optimization

### Task 3: Multi-Criteria Scoring System

**Estimated Time:** 4 hours

**Description:** Implement comprehensive scoring system with multiple relevance criteria.

**Implementation Details:**

- Create relevance scoring (query-content match)
- Implement specificity scoring (detail level)
- Add completeness scoring (information coverage)
- Create authority scoring (source credibility)
- Implement composite score calculation

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Relevance scoring accurately measures match quality
- [ ] Specificity scoring identifies detailed content
- [ ] Completeness scoring finds comprehensive answers
- [ ] Authority scoring considers source quality
- [ ] Composite scoring balances all criteria

### Task 4: Batch Reranking Implementation

**Estimated Time:** 3 hours

**Description:** Implement efficient batch processing for reranking multiple results.

**Implementation Details:**

- Create batch processing for result sets
- Implement optimal batch sizes for LLM API
- Add parallel processing for large batches
- Create batch result aggregation
- Implement batch error handling

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Batch processing improves efficiency
- [ ] Optimal batch sizes determined
- [ ] Parallel processing increases throughput
- [ ] Result aggregation maintains order
- [ ] Error handling preserves partial results

### Task 5: Fallback and Resilience

**Estimated Time:** 4 hours

**Description:** Implement fallback mechanisms and resilience for LLM unavailability.

**Implementation Details:**

- Create fallback to vector similarity ranking
- Implement circuit breaker for LLM failures
- Add caching for reranking results
- Create graceful degradation strategies
- Implement performance monitoring

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Fallback provides consistent user experience
- [ ] Circuit breaker prevents cascade failures
- [ ] Caching improves performance and resilience
- [ ] Degradation strategies maintain functionality
- [ ] Performance monitoring guides optimization

## Dependencies

- Sprint 3: Basic Search API (for initial result ranking)
- Sprint 4: Three-Hop Retrieval (for complex result sets)

## Technical Considerations

### Reranking Prompt Template

```
You are an expert procurement analyst. Rank the following search results by relevance to the query.

Query: "{user_query}"

Evaluate each result on:
1. Relevance: How well does it answer the query?
2. Specificity: How detailed and specific is the information?
3. Completeness: How comprehensive is the answer?
4. Authority: How credible is the source?

Results to rank:
{results_list}

Provide rankings with scores (1-10) and brief explanations.
```

### Scoring Criteria

- **Relevance (40%)**: Direct answer to user query
- **Specificity (25%)**: Level of detail and precision
- **Completeness (20%)**: Coverage of query aspects
- **Authority (15%)**: Source credibility and reliability

### Performance Requirements

- Rerank up to 20 results within 3 seconds
- Support concurrent reranking requests
- Maintain 99% uptime with fallback
- Cost optimization through caching

### Batch Configuration

```yaml
reranking_config:
  model: "gpt-4-turbo-preview"
  max_batch_size: 10
  timeout_seconds: 30
  enable_caching: true
  cache_ttl_hours: 24
  fallback_enabled: true
```

## Cost Management

### Optimization Strategies

- **Selective Reranking**: Only rerank top N results
- **Caching**: Cache reranking results for similar queries
- **Batch Processing**: Minimize API calls through batching
- **Smart Fallback**: Use LLM only when vector ranking insufficient

### Budget Controls

- Daily/monthly LLM usage limits
- Cost per reranking operation tracking
- Usage trend analysis and alerting
- Budget threshold notifications

## Quality Metrics

### Reranking Quality

- **Ranking Improvement**: Comparison with vector-only ranking
- **User Satisfaction**: Click-through rates on reranked results
- **Relevance Scores**: LLM-assigned vs human-evaluated scores
- **Consistency**: Ranking stability across similar queries

### Performance Metrics

- **Reranking Latency**: Time to rerank result sets
- **API Success Rate**: Successful LLM API calls
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Percentage of cached reranking results
- **Cost per Query**: LLM costs per search operation

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All tasks completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] LLM reranking improves result quality measurably
- [ ] Performance requirements met for production use
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms tested and reliable
- [ ] Cost optimization strategies implemented
- [ ] Quality metrics established and monitored

## Notes

- Consider implementing user feedback to improve reranking
- Plan for reranking model updates and improvements
- Monitor reranking effectiveness and adjust criteria
- Ensure reranking respects multi-tenant data isolation
