def truncate_to_token_limit(text, limit_tokens):
    """Intelligently truncate text to fit token limit."""
    pass
```

**Context Fusion Strategy:**
1. **Core text** (always included, highest priority)
2. **Section trail** (document navigation context)
3. **Document title** (document identification)
4. **Immediate neighbors** (local context)
5. **Sibling headings** (structural context)
6. **Key definitions** (domain context)

- Memory usage < 2GB per document
- Context extraction accuracy > 95%
- Token limit compliance 100%

### Edge Cases to Handle
