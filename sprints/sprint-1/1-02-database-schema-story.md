# User Story: Database Schema Implementation

## Story Details
**As a system architect, I want a robust database schema so that we can store documents, metadata, and relationships efficiently.**

**Story Points:** 8  
**Priority:** High  
**Sprint:** 1

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All tables from project documentation implemented
- [ ] Row-level security (RLS) configured
- [ ] Database migrations system in place
- [ ] Indexes optimized for query patterns
- [ ] Data validation constraints implemented

## Tasks

### Task 1: Core Schema Implementation
**Estimated Time:** 6 hours

**Description:** Implement the core database schema as defined in the project documentation.

**Implementation Details:**
- Create tenant and app_user tables with proper relationships
- Implement document table with doc_kind enum
- Create document_link table for RFQ-Offer relationships
- Implement chunk_meta table for vector metadata
- Create feedback table for learning system

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All tables created with correct column types
- [ ] Foreign key relationships properly defined
- [ ] Check constraints implemented for data validation
- [ ] Unique constraints prevent duplicate data
- [ ] Default values set appropriately

### Task 2: Row-Level Security (RLS) Configuration
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours

**Description:** Implement row-level security to ensure proper multi-tenant data isolation.

**Implementation Details:**
- Enable RLS on all tenant-scoped tables
- Create RLS policies for each user role (admin, analyst, viewer)
- Implement tenant context setting functions
- Test RLS policies with different user scenarios
- Document RLS implementation and usage

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] RLS enabled on all appropriate tables
- [ ] Policies prevent cross-tenant data access
- [ ] Role-based access controls working
- [ ] Performance impact assessed and acceptable
- [ ] RLS bypass for system operations documented

### Task 3: Database Indexes Optimization
**Estimated Time:** 3 hours

**Description:** Create optimized indexes based on expected query patterns.

**Implementation Details:**
- Analyze query patterns from retrieval pseudocode
- Create composite indexes for common filter combinations
- Implement partial indexes where appropriate
- Add indexes for foreign key relationships
- Document index strategy and maintenance

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Indexes created for all common query patterns
- [ ] Query performance tested with sample data
- [ ] Index maintenance strategy documented
- [ ] No unnecessary indexes that impact write performance
- [ ] Index usage monitored and validated

### Task 4: Data Validation and Constraints
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours

**Description:** Implement comprehensive data validation at the database level.

**Implementation Details:**
- Add check constraints for enum values and ranges
- Implement custom validation functions where needed
- Create triggers for data consistency enforcement
- Add constraints for business rules (e.g., confidence ranges)
- Test constraint violations and error handling

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All business rules enforced at database level
- [ ] Invalid data insertion properly prevented
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Constraint performance impact minimal
- [ ] Validation rules documented

### Task 5: Database Migration and Versioning
**Estimated Time:** 3 hours

**Description:** Set up proper database migration and versioning system.

**Implementation Details:**
- Create Alembic migration scripts for schema
- Implement migration rollback procedures
- Set up migration testing in CI/CD
- Create database seeding scripts for development
- Document migration best practices

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Migrations can be applied and rolled back safely
- [ ] Migration scripts are idempotent
- [ ] Development data seeding works
- [ ] Migration testing automated
- [ ] Migration documentation complete

## Dependencies
- Development Environment Setup (for database service)

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Considerations
- Use appropriate data types to minimize storage
- Implement efficient indexing strategy
- Consider partitioning for large tables in future
- Monitor query performance during development

### Security Considerations
- Implement proper RLS for multi-tenancy
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Audit trail for data modifications

### Scalability Considerations
- Design schema to support horizontal scaling
- Consider read replicas for query-heavy workloads
- Plan for data archiving and cleanup strategies
- Monitor database growth and performance

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All tasks completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Schema reviewed by database expert
- [ ] Performance testing completed with sample data
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Migration scripts tested in clean environment
- [ ] Documentation complete and reviewed

## Notes
- Follow PostgreSQL best practices for schema design
- Consider future requirements for analytics and reporting
- Ensure schema supports the three-hop retrieval pattern
- Plan for data retention and archival policies
