# Sprint 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure (2 weeks)

## Sprint Goal
Establish the foundational infrastructure, database schema, and basic API framework that will support all subsequent development.

## Sprint Objectives
- Set up development environment and project structure
- Implement core database schema with multi-tenancy
- Create basic API framework with authentication
- Establish testing infrastructure
- Set up initial CI/CD pipeline

## Deliverables
- Working development environment with Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL database with complete schema
- Basic FastAPI application with health checks
- Authentication and authorization framework
- Unit and integration test framework
- Initial documentation and setup guides

## User Stories

### Story 1-01: Development Environment Setup
**As a developer, I want a consistent development environment so that I can quickly start contributing to the project.**

**File:** [1-01-development-environment-story.md](1-01-development-environment-story.md)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Docker Compose setup with all required services
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] Database migrations working
- [ ] Hot reload enabled for development
- [ ] Documentation for local setup

**Story Points:** 5

### Story 1-02: Database Schema Implementation
**As a system architect, I want a robust database schema so that we can store documents, metadata, and relationships efficiently.**

**File:** [1-02-database-schema-story.md](1-02-database-schema-story.md)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All tables from project documentation implemented
- [ ] Row-level security (RLS) configured
- [ ] Database migrations system in place
- [ ] Indexes optimized for query patterns
- [ ] Data validation constraints implemented

**Story Points:** 8

### Story 1-03: API Framework & Authentication
**As a developer, I want a secure API framework so that we can build endpoints with proper authentication and authorization.**

**File:** [1-03-api-framework-story.md](1-03-api-framework-story.md)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] FastAPI application structure established
- [ ] JWT-based authentication implemented
- [ ] Role-based authorization (admin, analyst, viewer)
- [ ] Multi-tenant request context
- [ ] API documentation auto-generated

**Story Points:** 8

### Story 1-04: Testing Infrastructure
**As a developer, I want comprehensive testing infrastructure so that we can ensure code quality and prevent regressions.**

**File:** [1-04-testing-infrastructure-story.md](1-04-testing-infrastructure-story.md)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Unit test framework configured (pytest)
- [ ] Integration test setup with test database
- [ ] Test fixtures for common scenarios
- [ ] Code coverage reporting
- [ ] CI pipeline running tests

**Story Points:** 5

## Dependencies
- None (foundational sprint)

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Complex multi-tenancy implementation
  - **Mitigation**: Start with simple tenant isolation, iterate
- **Risk**: Database performance with RLS
  - **Mitigation**: Performance testing early, optimize indexes
- **Risk**: Authentication complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Use proven libraries, implement incrementally

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All user stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and merged to main branch
- [ ] Tests passing with >80% coverage
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Demo prepared for stakeholder review
