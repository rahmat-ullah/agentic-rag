# User Story: Testing Infrastructure

## Story Details
**As a developer, I want comprehensive testing infrastructure so that we can ensure code quality and prevent regressions.**

**Story Points:** 5  
**Priority:** High  
**Sprint:** 1

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit test framework configured (pytest)
- [ ] Integration test setup with test database
- [ ] Test fixtures for common scenarios
- [ ] Code coverage reporting
- [ ] CI pipeline running tests

## Tasks

### Task 1: Unit Testing Framework Setup
**Estimated Time:** 3 hours

**Description:** Set up pytest with proper configuration and plugins for unit testing.

**Implementation Details:**
- Install and configure pytest with useful plugins
- Set up test directory structure
- Configure pytest.ini with proper settings
- Create base test classes and utilities
- Set up test discovery and execution

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Pytest configured with appropriate plugins
- [ ] Test directory structure established
- [ ] Test configuration optimized for development
- [ ] Base test utilities created
- [ ] Tests can be run with simple commands

### Task 2: Integration Testing Setup
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours

**Description:** Set up integration testing with test database and API testing.

**Implementation Details:**
- Configure test database with Docker
- Set up FastAPI test client
- Create database transaction rollback for tests
- Implement test data factories
- Configure async testing support

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Test database isolated from development
- [ ] API endpoints can be tested end-to-end
- [ ] Database state properly reset between tests
- [ ] Test data creation automated
- [ ] Async tests working correctly

### Task 3: Test Fixtures and Factories
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours

**Description:** Create comprehensive test fixtures and data factories for common scenarios.

**Implementation Details:**
- Create user and tenant fixtures
- Implement document and chunk test factories
- Set up authentication fixtures
- Create database seeding for tests
- Implement cleanup and teardown fixtures

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Common test scenarios have fixtures
- [ ] Test data creation is consistent
- [ ] Fixtures properly scoped (function/session)
- [ ] Test isolation maintained
- [ ] Fixture documentation complete

### Task 4: Code Coverage and Quality
**Estimated Time:** 3 hours

**Description:** Set up code coverage reporting and quality metrics.

**Implementation Details:**
- Configure coverage.py with pytest
- Set up coverage reporting and thresholds
- Integrate with code quality tools
- Create coverage reports for CI/CD
- Set up quality gates

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Code coverage measured and reported
- [ ] Coverage thresholds enforced
- [ ] Quality metrics tracked
- [ ] Reports generated in CI/CD
- [ ] Quality gates prevent regression

### Task 5: CI/CD Pipeline Integration
**Estimated Time:** 2 hours

**Description:** Integrate testing into CI/CD pipeline with proper reporting.

**Implementation Details:**
- Configure GitHub Actions or similar CI
- Set up test execution in pipeline
- Implement test result reporting
- Configure failure notifications
- Set up parallel test execution

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Tests run automatically on commits
- [ ] Test results properly reported
- [ ] Pipeline fails on test failures
- [ ] Test execution time optimized
- [ ] Notifications configured for failures

## Dependencies
- Development Environment Setup (for test infrastructure)
- Database Schema Implementation (for integration tests)
- API Framework (for API testing)

## Technical Considerations

### Test Organization
- Separate unit tests from integration tests
- Use descriptive test names and documentation
- Group related tests in test classes
- Maintain test independence

### Performance
- Optimize test execution time
- Use parallel test execution where possible
- Minimize database operations in tests
- Cache expensive setup operations

### Maintainability
- Keep tests simple and focused
- Use factories instead of fixtures for complex data
- Avoid test interdependencies
- Regular test cleanup and refactoring

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
- Database models and relationships
- Business logic functions
- Utility functions and helpers
- Authentication and authorization logic

### Integration Tests
- API endpoint functionality
- Database operations
- Authentication flows
- Multi-tenant isolation

### End-to-End Tests
- Complete user workflows
- Document processing pipeline
- Query and retrieval flows
- Feedback system functionality

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All tasks completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Test suite runs successfully in CI/CD
- [ ] Code coverage meets minimum threshold (80%)
- [ ] Test documentation complete
- [ ] Team trained on testing practices
- [ ] Test strategy reviewed and approved

## Notes
- Focus on testing critical business logic thoroughly
- Ensure tests are maintainable and readable
- Consider property-based testing for complex logic
- Plan for performance and load testing in future sprints
