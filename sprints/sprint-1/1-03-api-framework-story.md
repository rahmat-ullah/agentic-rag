# User Story: API Framework & Authentication

## Story Details
**As a developer, I want a secure API framework so that we can build endpoints with proper authentication and authorization.**

**Story Points:** 8  
**Priority:** High  
**Sprint:** 1

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] FastAPI application structure established
- [ ] JWT-based authentication implemented
- [ ] Role-based authorization (admin, analyst, viewer)
- [ ] Multi-tenant request context
- [ ] API documentation auto-generated

## Tasks

### Task 1: FastAPI Application Structure
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours

**Description:** Set up the basic FastAPI application structure with proper organization.

**Implementation Details:**
- Create main FastAPI application with proper configuration
- Implement application factory pattern for different environments
- Set up proper logging configuration
- Create base response models and error handling
- Implement health check endpoints

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] FastAPI app starts successfully
- [ ] Environment-specific configuration loading
- [ ] Structured logging implemented
- [ ] Health check endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Error handling middleware configured

### Task 2: Authentication System
**Estimated Time:** 6 hours

**Description:** Implement JWT-based authentication system with proper security.

**Implementation Details:**
- Install and configure JWT library (python-jose)
- Create user authentication endpoints (login, refresh)
- Implement JWT token generation and validation
- Set up password hashing with bcrypt
- Create authentication middleware

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can authenticate with email/password
- [ ] JWT tokens generated with proper claims
- [ ] Token validation working correctly
- [ ] Password hashing secure and performant
- [ ] Authentication middleware protects endpoints

### Task 3: Authorization and Role-Based Access
**Estimated Time:** 5 hours

**Description:** Implement role-based authorization system supporting admin, analyst, and viewer roles.

**Implementation Details:**
- Create role-based permission decorators
- Implement authorization middleware
- Define permission matrix for different roles
- Create role assignment and management
- Test authorization with different user scenarios

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Role-based access controls working
- [ ] Permission decorators easy to use
- [ ] Authorization errors properly handled
- [ ] Role assignment system functional
- [ ] Permission matrix documented

### Task 4: Multi-Tenant Request Context
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours

**Description:** Implement multi-tenant context management for request processing.

**Implementation Details:**
- Create tenant context middleware
- Implement tenant extraction from JWT claims
- Set up request-scoped tenant context
- Create tenant validation and authorization
- Test multi-tenant isolation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Tenant context available in all requests
- [ ] Tenant isolation properly enforced
- [ ] Context middleware performant
- [ ] Tenant validation working
- [ ] Cross-tenant access prevented

### Task 5: API Documentation and Validation
**Estimated Time:** 3 hours

**Description:** Set up comprehensive API documentation and request/response validation.

**Implementation Details:**
- Configure OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Create Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Add proper API descriptions and examples
- Implement request validation middleware
- Set up API versioning strategy

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] OpenAPI documentation auto-generated
- [ ] Request/response validation working
- [ ] API documentation comprehensive and clear
- [ ] Validation errors properly formatted
- [ ] API versioning strategy implemented

### Task 6: Security Middleware and Headers
**Estimated Time:** 2 hours

**Description:** Implement security middleware and proper HTTP headers.

**Implementation Details:**
- Add CORS middleware with proper configuration
- Implement security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
- Set up rate limiting middleware
- Add request ID tracking for observability
- Configure proper error responses

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] CORS properly configured for frontend
- [ ] Security headers implemented
- [ ] Rate limiting working
- [ ] Request tracking functional
- [ ] Error responses secure and informative

## Dependencies
- Database Schema Implementation (for user authentication)
- Development Environment Setup (for running API)

## Technical Considerations

### Security Best Practices
- Use secure JWT configuration with proper algorithms
- Implement proper password policies
- Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Ensure sensitive data not logged
- Use HTTPS in production

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize JWT validation for high throughput
- Cache user permissions where appropriate
- Minimize database queries in middleware
- Use async/await properly throughout

### Scalability Considerations
- Design for stateless authentication
- Consider JWT refresh token strategy
- Plan for distributed rate limiting
- Support horizontal scaling

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All tasks completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Performance testing with concurrent requests
- [ ] API documentation reviewed and approved
- [ ] Authentication flow tested end-to-end
- [ ] Code reviewed by security expert

## Notes
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Consider OAuth2 integration for future
- Plan for API key authentication for service-to-service
- Ensure compliance with data protection regulations
