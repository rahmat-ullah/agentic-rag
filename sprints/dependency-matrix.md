## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Critical Path Risks
1. **Sprint 1 delays** → Affects all subsequent sprints
   - **Mitigation**: Start with minimal viable foundation, iterate
   
2. **Granite-Docling integration issues** (Sprint 2) → Blocks search functionality
   - **Mitigation**: Early proof of concept, fallback parsing options
   
3. **ChromaDB performance issues** (Sprint 3) → Affects all search functionality
   - **Mitigation**: Early performance testing, alternative vector stores evaluated

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- **Sprint 6 and 7** can be developed partially in parallel
- **Testing infrastructure** can be enhanced throughout all sprints
- **Documentation** can be developed continuously

## External Dependencies
