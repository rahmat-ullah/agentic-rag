## Technical Considerations

### Kubernetes Architecture
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: agentic-rag-api
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: agentic-rag-api
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: agentic-rag-api
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: api
        image: agentic-rag/api:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8000
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "512Mi"
            cpu: "250m"
          limits:
            memory: "1Gi"
            cpu: "500m"
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health
            port: 8000
          initialDelaySeconds: 30
          periodSeconds: 10
```

### Helm Chart Structure

- Zero-downtime deployments with blue-green strategy
- Rollback time < 2 minutes

### Environment Configurations
```yaml
environments:
  development:
    replicas: 1
    resources:
      requests: { memory: "256Mi", cpu: "100m" }
    database:
      size: "small"
  
  staging:
    replicas: 2
    resources:
      requests: { memory: "512Mi", cpu: "250m" }
    database:
      size: "medium"
  
  production:
    replicas: 3
    resources:
      requests: { memory: "1Gi", cpu: "500m" }
    database:
      size: "large"
```

## Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment
1. Deploy new version to green environment
2. Run validation tests on green environment
3. Switch traffic from blue to green
4. Monitor green environment health
5. Keep blue environment for quick rollback

### Rolling Updates
1. Update pods gradually (one at a time)
2. Validate each pod before proceeding
3. Monitor application health during update
4. Rollback if issues detected

### Canary Deployments
1. Deploy new version to small subset of users
2. Monitor metrics and user feedback
3. Gradually increase traffic to new version
4. Complete rollout or rollback based on results

## Quality Metrics

### Deployment Quality
- **Deployment Success Rate**: Percentage of successful deployments
- **Deployment Time**: Average time for complete deployment
- **Rollback Frequency**: Number of rollbacks per deployment
- **Configuration Drift**: Frequency of configuration inconsistencies

### Operational Efficiency
- **Mean Time to Deploy**: Average deployment duration
- **Change Failure Rate**: Percentage of deployments causing issues
- **Recovery Time**: Time to recover from failed deployments
- **Automation Coverage**: Percentage of automated deployment steps

- [ ] Kubernetes manifests deploy all system components
- [ ] Helm charts simplify deployment and configuration
