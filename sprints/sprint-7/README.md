## Dependencies
- All previous sprints (complete system required for production deployment)

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Production deployment complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Staging environment testing, gradual rollout
- **Risk**: Performance issues under production load
  - **Mitigation**: Load testing, performance monitoring, scaling plans
- **Risk**: Security vulnerabilities in production
  - **Mitigation**: Security scanning, penetration testing, regular updates

## Technical Architecture

### Production Infrastructure
- **Kubernetes cluster** with proper resource allocation
- **Load balancers** for high availability
- **Database clusters** with replication
- **Object storage** with backup and versioning
- **Monitoring stack** with alerting

### Security Measures
- **Network segmentation** and firewalls
- **Identity and access management** (IAM)
- **Encryption** for data at rest and in transit
- **Security scanning** and vulnerability management
- **Audit logging** and compliance monitoring

### Operational Excellence
- **Infrastructure as Code** (Terraform/Pulumi)
- **GitOps** deployment workflows
- **Automated testing** in CI/CD pipeline
- **Monitoring and alerting** for all components
- **Documentation** and knowledge management

## Definition of Done
