- Sprint 7: Production Deployment (for infrastructure)

## Technical Considerations

### Metrics Categories
```yaml
metrics:
  system_metrics:
    - cpu_usage
    - memory_usage
    - disk_usage
    - network_io
  
  application_metrics:
    - request_rate
    - response_time
    - error_rate
    - active_users
  
  business_metrics:
    - search_queries_per_minute
    - document_uploads_per_hour
    - user_satisfaction_score
    - system_utilization
```

### Alerting Rules
```yaml
alerting_rules:
  critical:
    - name: "High Error Rate"
      condition: "error_rate > 5%"
      duration: "5m"
      severity: "critical"
    
    - name: "Service Down"
      condition: "up == 0"
      duration: "1m"
      severity: "critical"
  
  warning:
    - name: "High Response Time"
      condition: "response_time > 2s"
      duration: "10m"
      severity: "warning"
```

### Performance Requirements
- Metrics collection overhead < 2% CPU
- Log processing latency < 30 seconds
- Dashboard loading time < 3 seconds
- Alert notification time < 1 minute

### Monitoring Stack Architecture
```
Applications → Prometheus → Grafana
     ↓
   Logs → Logstash → Elasticsearch → Kibana
     ↓
  Traces → OpenTelemetry → Jaeger/Zipkin
```
