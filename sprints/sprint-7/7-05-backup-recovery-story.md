## Technical Considerations

### Backup Strategy
```yaml
backup_strategy:
  postgresql:
    method: "pg_dump with WAL archiving"
    frequency: "daily full, continuous WAL"
    retention: "30 days local, 90 days remote"
  
  chromadb:
    method: "collection export"
    frequency: "daily"
    retention: "30 days local, 90 days remote"
  
  object_storage:
    method: "incremental sync"
    frequency: "hourly"
    retention: "30 days local, 1 year remote"
  
  configurations:
    method: "git repository backup"
    frequency: "on change"
    retention: "indefinite"
```

### Recovery Objectives
```yaml
recovery_objectives:
  critical_systems:
    rto: "1 hour"
    rpo: "15 minutes"
    priority: "highest"
  
  standard_systems:
    rto: "4 hours"
    rpo: "1 hour"
    priority: "medium"
  
  non_critical_systems:
    rto: "24 hours"
    rpo: "24 hours"
    priority: "lowest"
```

### Disaster Scenarios
- **Hardware Failure**: Server or storage failure
- **Data Center Outage**: Complete facility unavailability
- **Regional Disaster**: Natural disaster affecting entire region
- **Cyber Attack**: Ransomware or data corruption
- **Human Error**: Accidental deletion or misconfiguration

### Performance Requirements
- Backup completion within maintenance window
- Recovery initiation within 15 minutes of decision
- Full system recovery within defined RTO
- Backup validation completion within 1 hour

### Backup Architecture
```
Primary Data Center
├── PostgreSQL → Daily Backup → Local Storage
├── ChromaDB → Daily Export → Local Storage
├── Object Storage → Hourly Sync → Local Storage
└── Configurations → Git Backup → Repository

Cross-Region Replication
├── Local Storage → Sync → Remote Storage
├── Repository → Mirror → Remote Repository
└── Monitoring → Validate → Replication Health
```

## Recovery Procedures

### Database Recovery
1. **Assess Damage**
   - Determine data loss extent
   - Identify recovery point
   - Select appropriate backup

2. **Restore Database**
   - Stop application services
   - Restore from backup
   - Apply WAL files if needed
   - Validate data integrity

3. **Restart Services**
   - Start database service
   - Restart application services
   - Validate system functionality

### Vector Database Recovery
1. **Collection Assessment**
   - Identify affected collections
   - Determine recovery scope
   - Select backup version

2. **Collection Restore**
   - Stop ChromaDB service
   - Restore collection data
   - Restart ChromaDB service
   - Validate collection integrity

### Full System Recovery
1. **Infrastructure Setup**
   - Provision new infrastructure
   - Configure networking
   - Set up monitoring

2. **Data Restoration**
   - Restore all databases
