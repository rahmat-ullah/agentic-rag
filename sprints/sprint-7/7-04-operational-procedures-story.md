- Required tools/systems
- Environmental considerations

## Steps
1. Step-by-step instructions
2. Expected outcomes
3. Validation points

## Rollback
- Rollback triggers
- Rollback steps
- Validation of rollback

## Contacts

```

### Incident Classification
```yaml
incident_severity:
  critical:
    description: "System completely unavailable"
    response_time: "15 minutes"
    escalation: "immediate"
  
  high:
    description: "Major functionality impaired"
    response_time: "1 hour"
    escalation: "2 hours"
  
  medium:
    description: "Minor functionality affected"
    response_time: "4 hours"
    escalation: "8 hours"
  
  low:
    description: "Cosmetic or minor issues"
    response_time: "24 hours"
    escalation: "48 hours"
```

### Troubleshooting Decision Tree
```
Issue Reported
├── System Unavailable?
│   ├── Yes → Check Infrastructure
│   │   ├── Kubernetes Cluster Down?
│   │   ├── Database Unavailable?
│   │   └── Network Issues?
│   └── No → Check Application
│       ├── High Error Rate?
│       ├── Slow Response Time?
│       └── Feature Not Working?
```

### Performance Requirements
- Procedure execution time clearly documented
- Rollback completion < 5 minutes for critical issues
- Incident response initiation < 15 minutes
- Maintenance windows scheduled during low usage

### Operational Metrics
```yaml
operational_kpis:
  availability:
    target: "99.9%"
    measurement: "monthly"
  
  incident_response:
    target: "< 15 minutes"
    measurement: "mean time to acknowledge"
  
  deployment_success:
    target: "> 95%"
