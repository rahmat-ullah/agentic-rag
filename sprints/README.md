# Agentic RAG System - Sprint Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
This implementation plan breaks down the Agentic RAG System into manageable sprints, each delivering working functionality that builds toward the complete production-grade system.

## Sprint Structure
- **Sprint 1 (2 weeks)**: Foundation & Core Infrastructure
- **Sprint 2 (2 weeks)**: Document Ingestion Pipeline
- **Sprint 3 (2 weeks)**: Basic Retrieval & Vector Search
- **Sprint 4 (2 weeks)**: Contextual Retrieval & Three-Hop Search
- **Sprint 5 (2 weeks)**: Agent Orchestration & Advanced Features
- **Sprint 6 (2 weeks)**: Feedback System & Learning
- **Sprint 7 (2 weeks)**: Production Deployment & Observability

## Key Principles
- Each sprint delivers working, testable functionality
- Dependencies are clearly managed between sprints
- Risk mitigation through early validation of core concepts
- Continuous integration and testing throughout

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.11+ with FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 14+ for metadata, ChromaDB for vectors
- **Document Processing**: IBM Granite-Docling-258M
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI text-embedding-3-large
- **Storage**: S3-compatible object storage
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose → Kubernetes
- **Observability**: Prometheus + Grafana

## Success Criteria
Each sprint has specific acceptance criteria and deliverables that must be met before proceeding to the next sprint. The system should be demonstrable and testable at the end of each sprint.

## Risk Management
- Early validation of Granite-Docling integration
- Proof of concept for contextual retrieval in Sprint 3
- Performance testing throughout development
- Security and compliance considerations from Sprint 1

## Getting Started
1. Review individual sprint folders for detailed user stories and tasks
2. Check dependency matrix before starting each sprint
3. Follow the task breakdown for implementation order
4. Run tests continuously and update documentation

## File Naming Convention
All user story files follow the naming pattern: `[sprint-number]-[story-number]-[descriptive-name]-story.md`

Examples:
- `1-01-development-environment-story.md`
- `1-02-database-schema-story.md`
- `2-01-file-upload-storage-story.md`
- `4-01-contextual-chunking-story.md`

This ensures proper sequential ordering and easy identification of stories within each sprint.

## Sprint Dependencies
```
Sprint 1 → Sprint 2 → Sprint 3 → Sprint 4 → Sprint 5 → Sprint 6 → Sprint 7
    ↓         ↓         ↓         ↓         ↓         ↓
  Tests    Tests    Tests    Tests    Tests    Tests
```

Each sprint builds on the previous one, with comprehensive testing ensuring stability before progression.
