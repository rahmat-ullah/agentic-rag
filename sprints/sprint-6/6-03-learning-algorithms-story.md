## Technical Considerations

### Learning Algorithm Framework
```python
class LearningAlgorithm:
    def __init__(self, learning_rate: float = 0.01):
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.validation_threshold = 0.05
    
    def update(self, feedback: Feedback, current_score: float) -> float:
        """Update score based on feedback"""
        pass
    
    def validate_update(self, old_score: float, new_score: float) -> bool:
        """Validate that update improves performance"""
        pass
```

### Link Confidence Adjustment
```python
def adjust_link_confidence(link_id: str, feedback: Feedback) -> float:
    current_confidence = get_link_confidence(link_id)
    
    if feedback.rating > 3:  # Positive feedback
        adjustment = 0.1 * (feedback.rating - 3) / 2
    else:  # Negative feedback
        adjustment = -0.1 * (3 - feedback.rating) / 2
    
    new_confidence = max(0.0, min(1.0, current_confidence + adjustment))
    return new_confidence
```
