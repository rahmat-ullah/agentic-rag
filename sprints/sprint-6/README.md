## Dependencies
- Sprint 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure
- Sprint 2: Document Ingestion Pipeline
- Sprint 3: Basic Retrieval & Vector Search
- Sprint 4: Contextual Retrieval & Three-Hop Search
- Sprint 5: Agent Orchestration & Advanced Features

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Learning algorithms may degrade performance initially
  - **Mitigation**: A/B testing, gradual rollout, rollback capabilities
- **Risk**: User feedback quality and bias
  - **Mitigation**: Feedback validation, expert review, bias detection
- **Risk**: Re-embedding costs for corrections
  - **Mitigation**: Batch processing, cost monitoring, selective re-embedding

## Technical Architecture

### Feedback Loop
1. User interaction → feedback collection
2. Feedback analysis → learning signal extraction
3. Model updates → performance improvement
4. Validation → deployment of improvements
5. Monitoring → continuous assessment

### Learning Components
- **Feedback Processor**: Analyzes and categorizes feedback
- **Learning Engine**: Updates models based on feedback
- **Quality Monitor**: Tracks system performance metrics
- **Improvement Detector**: Identifies optimization opportunities
- **A/B Tester**: Validates improvements before deployment

### Key Features
- Real-time feedback processing
- Incremental learning without full retraining
- Bias detection and mitigation
- Quality regression prevention
- User expertise weighting
