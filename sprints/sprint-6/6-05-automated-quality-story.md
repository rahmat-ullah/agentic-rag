## Technical Considerations

### Quality Scoring Framework
```python
class QualityScorer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.dimensions = {
            'accuracy': 0.3,
            'completeness': 0.25,
            'freshness': 0.2,
            'relevance': 0.15,
            'usability': 0.1
        }
    
    def calculate_score(self, content: Content) -> float:
        """Calculate overall quality score"""
        scores = {}
        for dimension, weight in self.dimensions.items():
            scores[dimension] = self.score_dimension(content, dimension)
        
        return sum(score * weight for score, weight in 
                  zip(scores.values(), self.dimensions.values()))
```

### Quality Dimensions
- **Accuracy**: Factual correctness and reliability
- **Completeness**: Information coverage and depth
- **Freshness**: Recency and currency of information
- **Relevance**: Alignment with user needs and queries
- **Usability**: Clarity, formatting, and accessibility

### Automated Improvement Triggers
```yaml
improvement_triggers:
  link_quality:
    - confidence_score: "< 0.6"
    - negative_feedback: "> 30%"
    - click_through_rate: "< 10%"
  
  content_quality:
    - correction_frequency: "> 5 per month"
    - user_rating: "< 3.0/5.0"
    - bounce_rate: "> 70%"
  
  document_processing:
    - parsing_errors: "> 10%"
    - extraction_quality: "< 80%"
    - processing_failures: "> 5%"
```

### Performance Requirements
- Quality assessment processing < 1 hour for full system
- Real-time quality monitoring with 5-minute updates
- Automated improvements triggered within 24 hours
- Re-processing completion within 4 hours

### Quality Improvement Actions
```python
class QualityImprover:
    def improve_link_quality(self, link_id: str):
        """Automatically improve link quality"""
        # Re-calculate confidence scores
        # Update link metadata
        # Trigger re-validation
        pass
    
    def improve_content_quality(self, content_id: str):
        """Automatically improve content quality"""
        # Re-process document
        # Update embeddings
        # Refresh metadata
        pass
    
    def improve_search_quality(self, query_pattern: str):
        """Automatically improve search quality"""
        # Update ranking algorithms
        # Refresh query expansion
        # Optimize retrieval parameters
        pass
```

## Quality Monitoring

### Quality Metrics
- **Overall System Quality**: Weighted average of all quality scores
- **Content Quality Distribution**: Histogram of content quality scores
- **Quality Trend**: Quality changes over time
- **Improvement Rate**: Rate of quality improvements

### Alert Conditions
- Quality score drops below threshold
- Sudden increase in correction frequency
- High rate of negative feedback
- Processing error rate increase

### Improvement Tracking
```sql
CREATE TABLE quality_improvements (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    tenant_id UUID NOT NULL,
    improvement_type VARCHAR(50),
    target_id UUID, -- link_id, content_id, etc.
    trigger_reason VARCHAR(100),
    improvement_action VARCHAR(100),
    quality_before DECIMAL(3,2),
    quality_after DECIMAL(3,2),
    improvement_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    effectiveness_score DECIMAL(3,2)
);
```

## Automation Rules

### Link Quality Rules
- Auto-flag links with confidence < 0.5
- Re-validate links with negative feedback > 40%
- Remove links with consistent poor performance

### Content Quality Rules
- Re-process documents with correction rate > 10%
- Update embeddings for frequently corrected content
- Flag content with user rating < 2.5/5.0

### System Quality Rules
- Trigger system-wide analysis if overall quality drops 10%
- Initiate emergency review if critical quality metrics fail
- Auto-schedule maintenance for quality degradation
