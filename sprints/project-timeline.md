## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High-Risk Items

#### 1. Granite-Docling Integration Complexity
**Risk Level:** High  
**Impact:** Could delay Sprints 2-4  
**Probability:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- Early proof of concept in Sprint 2 Week 1
- Fallback to alternative document parsing libraries
- Dedicated ML engineer for integration
- Buffer time allocated in Sprint 2

#### 2. ChromaDB Performance at Scale
**Risk Level:** High  
**Impact:** Poor search performance, user experience issues  
**Probability:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- Performance testing from Sprint 3
- Alternative vector databases evaluated (Pinecone, Weaviate)
- Optimization strategies planned
- Horizontal scaling architecture

#### 3. OpenAI API Costs and Rate Limits
**Risk Level:** Medium  
**Impact:** Budget overruns, performance bottlenecks  
**Probability:** High  
**Mitigation:**
- Cost monitoring from Sprint 3
- Batch processing implementation
- Caching strategies
- Alternative embedding models evaluated

### Medium-Risk Items

#### 4. Three-Hop Search Complexity
**Risk Level:** Medium  
**Impact:** Complex queries may be slow or inaccurate  
**Probability:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- Incremental implementation approach
- Performance benchmarking at each hop
- Caching and optimization strategies
- Fallback to simpler search patterns

#### 5. LLM Reranking Latency
**Risk Level:** Medium  
**Impact:** Slow query response times  
**Probability:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- Selective reranking based on query complexity

**Risk Level:** Low  
**Impact:** Learning system may not improve effectively  
**Probability:** Low  
**Mitigation:**
- User training and onboarding
- Feedback incentives
- Expert review processes
- Synthetic feedback generation for testing

## Contingency Plans

### Schedule Delays
- **2-week delay:** Reduce scope of Sprint 6 (feedback system)
- **4-week delay:** Merge Sprints 5&6, reduce advanced features
- **6+ week delay:** Deliver MVP without learning system

### Technical Failures
- **Granite-Docling issues:** Fall back to alternative parsing (PyPDF2, Unstructured)
- **ChromaDB performance:** Switch to Pinecone or Weaviate
- **OpenAI API issues:** Use alternative embedding models (Sentence Transformers)

### Resource Constraints
- **Budget constraints:** Reduce LLM usage, optimize costs
- **Team availability:** Prioritize critical path items, reduce parallel work
- **Infrastructure limits:** Use cloud auto-scaling, optimize resource usage

## Go-Live Strategy

### Phased Rollout
1. **Alpha Release** (End of Sprint 5): Internal testing with limited documents
2. **Beta Release** (End of Sprint 6): Limited user group with feedback collection
3. **Production Release** (End of Sprint 7): Full deployment with monitoring

### Success Criteria for Go-Live
- [ ] All critical functionality working
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] User training completed
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting operational
- [ ] Backup and recovery tested
- [ ] Support procedures documented

## Post-Launch Considerations
