### Story 3-03: Vector Indexing System
**As a system, I want to automatically index document chunks as vectors so that they become searchable immediately after processing.**

**File:** [3-03-vector-indexing-story.md](3-03-vector-indexing-story.md)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Automatic vector indexing after document processing
- [ ] Chunk metadata properly stored with vectors
- [ ] Indexing pipeline handles failures gracefully
- [ ] Batch indexing for improved performance
- [ ] Index status tracking and monitoring

**As a user, I want to search for relevant documents using natural language queries so that I can find information quickly.**

**File:** [3-04-basic-search-api-story.md](3-04-basic-search-api-story.md)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Search endpoint accepts natural language queries
- [ ] Results ranked by relevance score
- [ ] Filtering by document type and metadata
- [ ] Pagination and result limiting
- [ ] Search performance within acceptable limits

**Story Points:** 8

### Story 3-05: Query Processing and Ranking
**As a system, I want to process user queries intelligently so that search results are relevant and well-ranked.**

**File:** [3-05-query-processing-story.md](3-05-query-processing-story.md)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Query preprocessing and enhancement
- [ ] Similarity search with configurable parameters
- [ ] Result reranking based on multiple factors
- [ ] Search result explanation and scoring
- [ ] Query performance optimization

**Story Points:** 5

## Dependencies
- Sprint 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure
- Sprint 2: Document Ingestion Pipeline (for chunks to index)

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: OpenAI API rate limits and costs
  - **Mitigation**: Implement batching, caching, and cost monitoring
- **Risk**: ChromaDB performance with large datasets
  - **Mitigation**: Performance testing, indexing optimization
- **Risk**: Embedding quality affecting search relevance
  - **Mitigation**: Quality validation, A/B testing different models

## Technical Architecture

### Vector Storage Strategy
- **RFQ Collection**: RFQ, RFP, Tender documents
- **Offer Collection**: OfferTech, OfferComm, Pricing documents
- **Metadata**: tenant_id, document_id, section_path, page_span

### Search Flow
1. Query preprocessing and enhancement
2. Vector similarity search in ChromaDB
3. Result filtering and ranking
4. Response formatting with metadata

### Key Components
- **Embedding Service**: OpenAI API integration
- **Vector Store**: ChromaDB client and operations
- **Search Service**: Query processing and retrieval
- **Indexing Service**: Automatic vector indexing
