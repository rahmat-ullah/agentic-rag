# User Story: ChromaDB Integration

## Story Details
**As a system, I want to store and retrieve document vectors efficiently so that I can perform fast similarity searches.**

**Story Points:** 8  
**Priority:** High  
**Sprint:** 3

- [ ] Data persists between container restarts
- [ ] Health checks implemented
- [ ] Performance settings optimized
- [ ] Service discovery working

### Task 2: Collection Management
**Estimated Time:** 3 hours

**Description:** Create and manage separate collections for different document types.

**Implementation Details:**
- Create rfq_collection for RFQ/RFP/Tender documents
- Create offer_collection for OfferTech/OfferComm/Pricing documents
- Implement collection initialization and validation
- Add collection metadata and configuration
- Create collection management utilities

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Collections created with proper configuration
- [ ] Collection separation working correctly
- [ ] Metadata properly configured
- [ ] Management utilities functional
- [ ] Collection validation implemented

### Task 3: Vector Operations Client
**Estimated Time:** 5 hours

**Description:** Implement comprehensive client for ChromaDB vector operations.

**Implementation Details:**
- Create async ChromaDB client wrapper
- Implement add, update, delete, query operations
- Add batch processing capabilities
- Implement error handling and retry logic
- Create operation logging and monitoring

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All vector operations working correctly
- [ ] Batch processing implemented
- [ ] Error handling robust
- [ ] Retry logic functional
- [ ] Operations properly logged

### Task 4: Multi-Tenant Isolation
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours

**Description:** Implement multi-tenant isolation using metadata filtering.

**Implementation Details:**
- Add tenant_id to all vector metadata
- Implement tenant-based filtering for queries
- Create tenant isolation validation
- Add tenant-specific collection management
- Implement tenant data cleanup

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Tenant isolation properly implemented
- [ ] Cross-tenant access prevented
- [ ] Filtering working correctly
- [ ] Validation preventing data leaks
- [ ] Cleanup procedures working

### Task 5: Performance Optimization
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours

**Description:** Optimize ChromaDB performance for production workloads.

**Implementation Details:**
- Configure optimal index settings
- Implement connection pooling
- Add query performance monitoring
- Optimize batch sizes and operations
- Create performance benchmarks

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Index settings optimized
- [ ] Connection pooling implemented
- [ ] Performance monitoring active
- [ ] Batch operations optimized
- [ ] Benchmarks established

## Dependencies
- Sprint 1: Development Environment Setup (for Docker services)
- Sprint 2: Document Chunking Pipeline (for vector data)

## Technical Considerations

### ChromaDB Configuration
- **Storage**: Persistent volumes for data retention
- **Memory**: Adequate RAM allocation for performance
- **Indexing**: Optimal index configuration for query speed
- **Concurrency**: Connection pooling for multiple clients

### Collection Strategy
- **RFQ Collection**: RFQ, RFP, Tender documents
- **Offer Collection**: OfferTech, OfferComm, Pricing documents
- **Metadata**: tenant_id, document_id, section_path, page_span

### Performance Requirements
- Query response time < 100ms for simple searches
- Support for 1M+ vectors per collection
- Concurrent query handling
- Efficient batch operations

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All tasks completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] ChromaDB integration tested with sample data
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation validated
- [ ] Error handling tested
- [ ] Documentation complete

## Notes
- Consider ChromaDB version compatibility
- Plan for future scaling and sharding
- Monitor memory usage and optimize
- Ensure backup and recovery procedures
