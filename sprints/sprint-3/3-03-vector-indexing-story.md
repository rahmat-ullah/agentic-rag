# User Story: Vector Indexing System

## Story Details
**As a system, I want to automatically index document chunks as vectors so that they become searchable immediately after processing.**

**Story Points:** 5  
**Priority:** High  
**Sprint:** 3

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automatic vector indexing after document processing
- [ ] Chunk metadata properly stored with vectors
- [ ] Indexing pipeline handles failures gracefully
- [ ] Batch indexing for improved performance
- [ ] Index status tracking and monitoring

## Tasks

### Task 1: Automatic Indexing Pipeline
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours

**Description:** Implement automatic vector indexing triggered after document processing completion.

**Implementation Details:**
- Create indexing trigger after document chunking
- Implement async indexing to prevent blocking
- Add indexing queue for processing order
- Create indexing status tracking
- Implement indexing completion notifications

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Indexing automatically triggered after chunking
- [ ] Async processing prevents system blocking
- [ ] Indexing queue manages processing order
- [ ] Status tracking provides visibility
- [ ] Completion notifications sent

### Task 2: Metadata Storage Integration
**Estimated Time:** 3 hours

**Description:** Ensure chunk metadata is properly stored with vectors in ChromaDB.

**Implementation Details:**
- Map chunk metadata to vector metadata fields
- Implement metadata validation before storage
- Add metadata indexing for efficient filtering
- Create metadata update mechanisms
- Implement metadata consistency checks

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All chunk metadata stored with vectors
- [ ] Metadata validation prevents invalid data
- [ ] Metadata indexing enables efficient filtering
- [ ] Update mechanisms work correctly
- [ ] Consistency checks prevent data corruption

### Task 3: Error Handling and Recovery
**Estimated Time:** 3 hours

**Description:** Implement robust error handling and recovery for indexing failures.

**Implementation Details:**
- Add retry logic for failed indexing operations
- Implement dead letter queue for persistent failures
- Create error logging and monitoring
- Add manual retry capabilities
- Implement partial indexing recovery

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Retry logic handles temporary failures
- [ ] Dead letter queue captures persistent failures
- [ ] Error logging provides debugging information
- [ ] Manual retry capabilities available
- [ ] Partial failures can be recovered

### Task 4: Batch Indexing Optimization
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours

**Description:** Implement batch indexing for improved performance and efficiency.

**Implementation Details:**
- Create batch processing for multiple chunks
- Implement optimal batch sizes for ChromaDB
- Add parallel batch processing
- Create batch status tracking
- Implement batch failure handling

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Batch processing improves indexing performance
- [ ] Optimal batch sizes determined and implemented
- [ ] Parallel processing increases throughput
- [ ] Batch status tracking provides visibility
- [ ] Batch failures handled appropriately

### Task 5: Index Status Monitoring
**Estimated Time:** 2 hours

**Description:** Implement comprehensive monitoring and status tracking for the indexing system.

**Implementation Details:**
- Create indexing metrics and dashboards
- Implement status tracking for documents and chunks
- Add performance monitoring for indexing operations
- Create alerting for indexing failures
- Implement indexing health checks

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Metrics and dashboards provide visibility
- [ ] Status tracking covers all indexing stages
- [ ] Performance monitoring identifies bottlenecks
- [ ] Alerting notifies of failures
- [ ] Health checks validate system status

## Dependencies
- Sprint 2: Document Chunking Pipeline (for chunks to index)
- Sprint 3: ChromaDB Integration (for vector storage)
- Sprint 3: OpenAI Embeddings Pipeline (for embeddings to index)

## Technical Considerations

### Indexing Strategy
- **Trigger Points**: After successful document chunking
- **Processing Mode**: Asynchronous to prevent blocking
- **Batch Size**: Optimized for ChromaDB performance
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive retry and recovery

### Performance Requirements
- Index 1000 chunks within 2 minutes
- Handle concurrent indexing requests
- Maintain system responsiveness during indexing
- Efficient memory usage during batch processing

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Indexing throughput and latency metrics
- Error rate and failure type tracking
- Queue depth and processing status
- Resource utilization monitoring

## Error Scenarios

### Indexing Failures
- ChromaDB connection issues → Retry with backoff
- Invalid vector data → Validation and error reporting
- Memory exhaustion → Batch size adjustment
- Concurrent access conflicts → Queue management

### Recovery Procedures
- Failed batch recovery → Individual chunk processing
- Partial indexing → Status tracking and completion
- Data corruption → Validation and re-indexing
- System restart → Queue persistence and recovery

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All tasks completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Automatic indexing working for all document types
- [ ] Error handling tested with failure scenarios
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting functional
- [ ] Documentation complete

## Notes
- Consider implementing indexing priority levels
- Plan for future incremental indexing capabilities
- Monitor indexing costs and optimize accordingly
- Ensure indexing supports multi-tenant isolation
